# Free Code Camp exercises

Working my way through the exercises at [free code camp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) for practice & to make sure that I follow good TDD principles, make good use of git (appropriate branching, commit message names, etc) and to all round practice my coding. 

I'll be starting with [ES6](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/explore-differences-between-the-var-and-let-keywords) and going from there. 

Thanks.
